In this project we perform data analysis on Zomato Data. 
To address our analysis we respond to the subsequent inquiries:
1. Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
2. Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
3. What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?
To perform analysis following python libraries are used to analyze Zomato data: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn.
